            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>A hypothetical 8-person crew on a Mars round-trip mission would accumulate **12,600 kg of inorganic waste** (packaging, textiles, structural materials) over three years. Transporting resources from Earth or trash back to Earth is expensive and inefficient. The core challenge is to **design sustainable systems to manage, reuse, or recycle this inorganic waste** on the Martian surface to achieve a circular economy.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Astronauts cannot rely on returning waste to Earth like on the ISS. Future Mars missions must implement sanitation/recycling to process common waste items (fabrics, food packaging, foam, etc.) that are difficult to reuse in their original form. **Innovative, cutting-edge solutions** are needed to develop a recycling infrastructure for planetary missions, focusing on maximizing resource recovery and minimizing waste outputs.</p>

            <h3>Objectives: Design a Sustainable Recycling System for Jezero Crater</h3>
            <p>Design a system that processes waste to address one or more of the following scenarios, focusing on **immediate recycling/reuse solutions**:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Residence Renovations:</strong> How to reuse structural elements (aluminum, polymer composites) and foam packaging after habitat inflation.</li>
                <li><strong>Cosmic Celebrations:</strong> How to recycle everyday items like clothing, wipes, and food pouches for a celebratory event.</li>
                <li><strong>Daring Discoveries:</strong> How to reuse materials from scientific experiments, like EVA waste, filter instruments, and surplus carbon from oxygen extraction.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="focus-points"><strong>Key Focus:</strong> Maximize resource recovery, minimize energy/water inputs, and minimize unusable outputs. Avoid burning/incinerating waste, and prevent the generation of toxic emissions or microplastics.</p>
